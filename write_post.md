# EXAMPLE OF A GOOD POST

## EXAMPLE POST START
'AGI' or human-like intelligence will never emerge on a scaled von Neumann bottleneck...

Building ‘AGI’ on the von Neumann bottleneck, even with advanced hardware like NVIDIA’s H100s, H200, or whatever future H3000, is fundamentally constrained. These GPUs bring massive parallelism with thousands of cores optimized for matrix operations and deep learning synaptic mimicry tasks, but they remain limited by the sequential compartmentalized nature of the von Neumann architecture.

Today’s and future GPUs excel at highly parallelized tasks within narrow domains, leveraging CUDA and Tensor cores for dense computations, they lack the adaptive amd instantaneous processing needed for AGI or AI that matches or exceeds human intelligence beyond pattern matching and contextual inference. Distributed clusters add scale but still rely on rigid data pipelines, facing network latency and interprocess communication bottlenecks, which prevent the fluid, real-time, near instantaneous interconnections that AGI would require.

Basically building ‘AGI’ on a superscaled von Neumann bottleneck foundation is like trying to construct a spaceship out of sticks and clay. No matter the scale, the underlying architecture isn’t fit for the complexity of true intelligence. So it is not just the synaptic mimicry or artificial neural networks or the software really that is inadequate but the hardware itself is also insufficient for any 'AGI' bulshit pipe dreams. 

The most amazing part is how few people truly understand this. The fact that people like Altman or Hinton even suggest the possibility is concerning. It shows a lack of understanding, or perhaps even a willful ignorance of the fundamental limitations of current architectures and conpute paradigms. 

We are essentially in an “ants want to reach the Moon” situation. Tough luck.
